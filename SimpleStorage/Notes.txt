we just ran 
forge init 

which gives me intial project directories kinda like a skeleton.. a boilerplate

typing anvil in the terminal spins up a local chain which can be added to metamask via the rpc url.
we can deploy our contracts on whi anvil chain for testing.

we deploy a smart contract in anvil chain using the command 
forge build or forge compile

now we are learning to write scripts in foundry to default execute to deploy the smart contracts that we build

we run the deploy scripts using the command
also in importing the file, vsc shows error, but it compiles fine with foundry
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol

this will deploy the contract to temporary anvil chain. that is why it provides the contract address

to deploy to anvil chain, start the chain and set the rpc url in forge script command to deploy there

issue with using .env is that we have allot of private info there kepy in plane text
so we encrpy the private keys in ERC-255 json based

So now we interact with contract using CLI using cast send which sends commands
we ran the contract using the command

cast send 0x5b73C5498c1E3b4dbA84de0F1833c4a029d90519 "store(uint256)" 123 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
where store is the functin name and 123 is the arguement going in the function


now for not sending and instead reciveinng the value, we write
cast call 0x5b73C5498c1E3b4dbA84de0F1833c4a029d90519 "retrieve()"

forge fmt command will automatically format the complete code
