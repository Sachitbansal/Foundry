we need to create somthing called a remapping to tell foundry that
import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

this is pointing to some local file in out project and not github since this convtrion is of remix and not foundry
so we need to tell foundry that "@chainlink/contracts" points to chainlink-brownie-contracts/contracts and our work there is done

foundry.toml is kinda like the package.json of the foundry
it contains version and remappings and stuff



we do forge test to run tests of smart contract

so now what is happening is that AggregatorV3Interface has contract address of sepolia but when we run here, foudnry will spin up anvil chain and try to find the contract address on that anvil chain

So there are workarounds for using addresses outside our systems
so we can send fork url of --forke-url and put in Sepolia RPC URL to run test on this chain
